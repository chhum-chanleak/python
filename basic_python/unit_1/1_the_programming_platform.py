# 1. What is a programming language?

  # -> A programming language is the way humans interact with computers to make them perform tasks.

# 2. Coder editors

  # -> We use code editors because they make writing code easier, faster, and less error-prone than using a plain text editor.

  # Think of a code editor as a workbench for programmers.

  # Main reasons we use code editors

  # 1. Syntax highlighting

    # Keywords, variables, and strings show in different colors

    # Makes code easier to read and debug

    # Example:

def add2(num):
  result = num + 2
  return result

  # 2. Auto-completion (IntelliSense)

    # Suggests code as you type

    # Reduces typing and mistakes

  # 3. Error detection

    # Shows warnings and problems while you write

    # Helps you fix bugs early

  # 4. Built-in terminal

    # Run your program without leaving the editor

  # 5. Project/file management

    # Organizes lots of files into folders

  # 6. Extensions & tools

  # Add support for Python, JavaScript, Git, etc.
