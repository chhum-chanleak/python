# Exercise 3: Type Conversion
# Task: You are given a variable count that is currently a string. Convert this string variable into an integer and then increment its value by 1. Print the final result.

# count_str = "99"

# count_str = "99"

# int(count_str) + 1

# print(int(count_str) + 1)

# Exercise 4: Exponential and Negative Numbers

# Task: Calculate the result of negative five raised to the power of three. Store the result in a variable and print it. Use the exponentiation operator (**).

# base = -5
# exponent = 3

# -5 ** 3

# result = -5 ** 3

# print(result)

# Exercise 1: Basic Float Operations

# Task: Create two float variables, price and tax_rate. Calculate the total tax amount and the final total cost (price + tax). Print both results rounded to two decimal places.

# price = 50.0
# tax_rate = 0.075

# price = 49.99
# taxRate = 0.075 # 0.1%

# tax = price * taxRate
# totalCost = price + tax

# print(f"Tax amount: {tax}")
# print(f"Total cost: {totalCost}")

# Exercise 3: Type Conversion

# Task: You are given a variable count_str that is currently a string. Convert this string variable into an integer and then increment its value by 1. Print the final result.

# count_str = "99"

# countStr = "99"

# int(countStr) + 1

# print(int(countStr) + 1)

# Exercise 4: Exponential and Negative Numbers

# Task: Calculate the result of negative five raised to the power of three. Store the result in a variable and print it. Use the exponentiation operator (**).

# -5 ** 3

# result = -5 ** 3
# print(result)

# Exercise 1: Basic Float Operations

# Task: Create two float variables, price and tax_rate. Calculate the total tax amount and the final total cost (price + tax). Print both results rounded to two decimal places.

# price = 49.99
# tax_rate = 0.075

# price = 49.99
# taxRate = 0.075 # 0.075%

# tax = price * taxRate
# totalCost = price + (price * taxRate)

# print(round(tax, 3))
# print(round(totalCost, 3))

# Exercise 2: Calculating Area of a Circle

# Task: Use the value 3.14159 for Pi and store it in a float variable. Given a radius of 5.5, calculate the area of the circle using the formula pi * r^2. Print the result.

# # pi = 3.14159
# # radius = 5.5

# pi = 3.14159
# radius = 5.5

# area = pi * (radius ** 2)

# print(area)

# Exercise 3: Type Conversion from Integer and Division

# Task: You have an integer dividend and an integer divisor. Perform true division (which results in a float) and store the result. Then, convert the result back to an integer using explicit type casting and print both.

# dividend = 100
# divisor = 7

# dividend = 100
# divisor = 7

# result = dividend / divisor

# print(result)
# print(int(result))

# Exercise 4: Exponential Notation and Precision

# Task: Assign the value 1.23 times 10^5 to a float variable using exponential notation (e.g., 1.235). Print the variable to see its standard representation, and then print its type.

largeNumber = 1.23 * (10 ** 5)

print(largeNumber)

print(type(largeNumber))

# Exercise 1: Concatenation and Length

# Task: Create two string variables, first_name and last_name. Concatenate them with a space in between to form full_name. Then, calculate and print the length of full_name.

# first_name = "Alan"
# last_name = "Turing"

firstName = "Alan"
lastName = "Turing"

fullName = firstName + " " + lastName

print(len(fullName))
