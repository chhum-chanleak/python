# 1.
# # CODE WITH ERROR
# # We have three separate variables
# point1 = 10
# point2 = 20
# point3 = 30

# The code attempts to access a fourth point, which doesn't exist
# fourth_point = point4
# print(fourth_point)

# 2.
# CODE WITH ERROR
# Attempting to add a string and an integer
# text = "Result is: "
# number = 100
# final_output = text + number
# print(final_output)

# 3. What type of errors are these?

# #py0i

# 1.
# CODE WITH ERROR
# print "Hello, Syntax!"
# Goal: Correct the code to successfully print the message.

# 2.
# CODE WITH ERROR
# temperature = 30
# if temperature > 25
#   print("It's a hot day.")
# Goal: Correct the conditional statement so that Python recognizes the block structure.

# Have one student predict the output first.
# Run the code and observe differences.
# Discuss the error (prin) and how Python identifies it.
# Discuss type differences: "2" + "5" is string concatenation vs 8 / 2 is numeric division.

# What does each string expression evaluate to?
# print("hello" + " world")
# print("data" + "_" + "science")
# prin("AI" + " " + "tools")  # intentional typo to discuss error
# print("2" + "5" + "8.3")

# Display a divider surrounded by blank lines
# print()
# print("==========")
# print()

# print("Evaluating integer and float expressions...")

# What does each numeric expression evaluate to?
# print(10 + 5)
# print(3.5 + 2.5)
# print(100)
# print(-7 + 0.33)
# print(8 / 2)  # test float division

# Exercises: Assignments and initialization

# 1. Create a variable city and assign it "Singapore". Print it.

# 2. Create two variables a = 7 and b = 3. Print their sum.

# 3. Reassign the value of a to 10 and print the new sum with b.

# 4. Create a variable is_hungry and assign it True. Print it.

# Exercise 1: Creating a list
# Task:
# Create a list called scores that contains these numbers in order:
# 10, 20, 30, 40
# Then print the list.
# Goal: Get comfortable writing a list literal.

#  Exercise 2: Accessing (indexing) elements

# names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]

# Task:
# Print "Bob" using its index
# Print "Alice" using its index

# Exercise 3: Modifying a list

# cities = ["Paris", "London", "Tokyo"]

# Task:
# Change "London" to "Berlin" and print the updated list.

# Exercise 4: Adding elements

# numbers = [1, 2, 3]

# Task:
# Add the number 4 to the end of the list, then print the list.
